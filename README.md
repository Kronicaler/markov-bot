# markov-bot
A discord chat and music bot written in Rust

# Deployment instructions

## Dependencies

The bot _will_ work without these dependencies but it's music functionality won't work.

* youtube-dl
* opus 
* yt-search
* ffmpeg


In the same folder as the executable you'll need a .env file with the environment variables DISCORD_TOKEN and APPLICATION_ID.
## Example: 
````
DISCORD_TOKEN=OPc7yOsdaGAEgegTU2.GakxzW23dh6g4G46GADKJBZs
APPLICATION_ID=973467367436746574
````

After you've installed the dependencies and created a .env file with your discord token and application id you can run the bot.
